<p>In June 2023 I installed Wezterm and a month later I quit Tmux.<br>
It&rsquo;s been more than a year since I quit, and I can confidently say that I won&rsquo;t go back.<br>
In this blog post I will go through why I replaced my workflow in Tmux with Wezterms multiplexing capabilities, and the pros and cons of doing so.</p>
<h2 id="how-did-i-use-tmux">How did I use Tmux?</h2>
<h5 id="panes--windows">Panes &amp; Windows</h5>
<p>The main use case I had from Tmux was to write my code in Neovim, and then run the code in a split pane.
In doing so I would usually have my Neovim instance running in a zoomed pane, and then unzoom to compile or whatever I would need a terminal for.
If I were to use something like <a href="https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit">Lazygit</a> or quickly edit a file in another directory, then I would use either a floating pane or a new Tmux window (tab for regular folks) as to not interrupt/pollute my Neovim, split layout.</p>
<h5 id="sessions">Sessions</h5>
<p>As a CS student I would also frequently switch context throughout the day/week, as I would be writing a compiler in one course and a matrix multiplication algorithm in another.
As such I would switch git repositories frequently. For doing this I used my favorite Tmux plugin <a href="https://github.com/joshmedeski/t-smart-tmux-session-manager">t</a>, a predecessor of <a href="https://github.com/joshmedeski/sesh">sesh</a>. This plugin would use <a href="https://github.com/junegunn/fzf">fzf</a> and <a href="https://github.com/ajeetdsouza/zoxide">zoxide</a> to quickly create/connect to Tmux sessions with the session name and cwd set to a chosen directory. This made it super quick to switch context, and changed the way I work in the terminal.</p>
<h2 id="why-did-i-switch">Why did I switch?</h2>
<p>But why switch from Tmux? I though Tmux is what all the cool h4ck3rs are using?<br>
Tmux is amazing, and I don&rsquo;t have many reasons for making the switch, but here are some:</p>
<h5 id="not-having-to-startattach-to-tmux">Not having to start/attach to Tmux</h5>
<p>One issue I was having when I used Tmux was this: I’d open my terminal, navigate to a repository, and start Neovim to begin programming.
Code is flowing from my brain, through my fingers, to the screen! I am truly in the zone now, feeling like Vim Diesel! Quickly splitting the pane to compi&hellip;<br>
Oh, wait&hellip; I forgot to attach to Tmux. Now I have to stop and open everything again inside a Tmux session to split the pane. Slowing me down and making me lose focus&hellip;<br>
To fix this issue, one can simply make starting and attaching to a Tmux session a part of spawning a shell.
Sure, it works, but is a tiny bit slower whenever you open a shell and I wasn&rsquo;t a big fan of this.</p>
<p>Wezterm, a terminal emulator with builtin multiplexing, does not suffer from this problem.
In Wezterm you can simply split panes, spawn tabs etc. as it is attached to a default Session (Workspace) whenever you start the terminal.
This might seem like a minor inconvenience, but was actually the main reason that I made the switch to Wezterm.</p>
<h5 id="tmux-configuration-sucks">Tmux configuration sucks</h5>
<p>As a programmer I find the Tmux configuration experience a lot worse than Wezterm. Wezterm is configured in Lua which is a very simple, but powerful language, and in my opinion, perfect for configurations.
At least for me Lua offers better readability and maintainability than the Tmux config.
It is also easier to extend core functionality, as you don&rsquo;t need to rely on shell scripts to add logic to your configuration.</p>
<p>Below is an example of a Tmux and Wezterm keybind to split the current pane vertically and spawn top in the left pane.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e"># Tmux</span>

</span></span></code></pre></div><div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-lua" data-lang="lua"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e">-- Wezterm</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>config.keys <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> {
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  {
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    key <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;t&#39;</span>,
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    mods <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;CTRL&#39;</span>,
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    action <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> wezterm.action.SplitPane {
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>      direction <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;Left&#39;</span>,
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>      command <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> { args <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> { <span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;top&#39;</span> } },
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>      size <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> { Percent <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">50</span> },
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    },
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  },
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>}
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>I personally find it very hard to understand the Tmux keybind, but that might just be a skill issue&hellip;<br>
Furthermore, if you are using Tmux, then you are most likely also using a terminal emulator with another configuration.
Combining the multiplexer and terminal configuration into one also improves the simplicity and maintainability of my dotfiles.</p>
<h5 id="trying-new-software-is-fun">Trying new software is fun</h5>
<p>The number one reason that I switched might just be because I was looking into terminal emulators and in my search of finding the best, I found Wezterm. Reading the <a href="https://wezfurlong.org/wezterm/multiplexing.html">multiplexing</a> and the <a href="https://wezfurlong.org/wezterm/recipes/workspaces.html">Workspaces/Sessions sections</a> of the docs, I figured I could replace my Tmux setup with the features built into Wezterm.
So over the summer break I replicated most of the features from Tmux in my Wezterm config, and it was very enjoyable to configure it to my liking.</p>
<h2 id="what-are-the-pros">What are the pros?</h2>
<p>Wezterm has a lot of features which I wasn&rsquo;t aware of before I switched which I only discovered after switching.</p>
<h5 id="the-killer-feature-of-wezterms-domains">The killer feature of Wezterms domains</h5>
<p>Wezterm has the concept of domains. Domains are like the &ldquo;context&rdquo; for which a pane exists.
By default you use &ldquo;local&rdquo; domains, which are just regular shell sessions.
However in Wezterm you can also spawn panes in other domains, like a ssh domain, which will make a pane with an active ssh connection.
This pane can then be split, opened in a new tab, ect. Just like a regular &ldquo;local&rdquo; pane, but without you having to manually ssh into the server every time.
This means that you essentially get the layout features you are used to from Tmux, without having to have Tmux installed on the server.
This also works for other domains, like <a href="https://wezfurlong.org/wezterm/config/lua/WslDomain.html">WSL</a>, <a href="https://wezfurlong.org/wezterm/multiplexing.html#unix-domains">Unix sockets</a>, <a href="https://wezfurlong.org/wezterm/multiplexing.html#tls-domains">TLS</a> and you can even create your own domains, like <a href="https://wezfurlong.org/wezterm/config/lua/ExecDomain.html#example-docker-domains">docker domains</a>.</p>
<p>I am not aware of a feature like this in Tmux, although it is probably possible with some plugin or configuration, but the feature is very well integrated into Wezterm.
With some nice keybindings, like <a href="https://github.com/DavidRR-F/quick_domains.wezterm">quick_domains</a> then it is amazing to work with, especially when you don&rsquo;t have access to Tmux on a server.</p>
<p>Below is gif of me spawning a pane in a domain which automatically creates a ssh connection to a Raspberry Pi. I am able to freely split panes like I would with regular (&ldquo;local&rdquo;) panes and splitting a pane, will spawn a split pane within that specific domain. This is why the left panes both are on my laptop, while the right panes are on the Raspberry Pi.

<h5 id="great-documentation-and-apis">Great documentation and APIs</h5>
<p>I have spent many hours reading through the documentation of Wezterm and all the features are really well documented and most have easy to follow examples. Through reading the docs I have discovered many interesting ways to use features I would otherwise ignore to improve my workflow, like <a href="https://wezfurlong.org/wezterm/config/lua/keyassignment/PromptInputLine.html#example-of-interactively-picking-a-name-and-creating-a-new-workspace">this example</a> of interactivly creating and naming workspaces, or the <a href="https://wezfurlong.org/wezterm/config/lua/ExecDomain.html#example-docker-domains">docker domain</a> from before.</p>
<h5 id="the-best-maintainer-and-community-in-open-source">The best maintainer and community in Open Source</h5>
<p>Sure, that is a bit of a bold statement, but Wez is a really great maintainer. Not only for his work on Wezterm, but for the way he approaches contributers. He is always very friendly, appreciative and gives detailed feedback on PRs. I aspire to be like him whenever I&rsquo;m giving feedback.<br>
The community is also really supportive and helpful, whether it is people on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wezterm/">Reddit</a>, <a href="https://app.element.io/#/room/#wezterm:matrix.org">Matrix</a> or <a href="https://github.com/wez/wezterm/discussions">Github</a>. I have never seen any communication that left a bad taste in my mouth.</p>
<h2 id="what-are-the-cons">What are the cons?</h2>
<p>After a year of use I can tell that Wezterm does fall short in some areas compared to Tmux.</p>
<h5 id="not-as-popular">Not as popular</h5>
<p>Wezterm is a newer terminal with a smaller group of users.
As such there is less information about Wezterm compared to Tmux, which can make it harder to troubleshoot specific issues.<br>
It also means that some of the plugins from Tmux, like <a href="https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tmux-resurrect">tmux-resurrect</a> or the <a href="https://github.com/joshmedeski/t-smart-tmux-session-manager">t plugin</a> I mentioned above, was not available when I switched.
This made me develop replacement plugins, like: <a href="https://github.com/MLFlexer/resurrect.wezterm">resurrect</a> and <a href="https://github.com/MLFlexer/smart_workspace_switcher.wezterm">smart_workspace_switcher</a>, however now I don&rsquo;t find that I am missing any plugins.<br>
And in the last few months a lot of other plugins have been developed, see the <a href="https://github.com/michaelbrusegard/awesome-wezterm">awesome-wezterm list</a>.</p>
<h5 id="missing-floating-panes">Missing floating panes</h5>
<p>One feature I&rsquo;m missing from Tmux is the ability to have floating panes. This is not yet a part of Wezterm, but in recent months <a href="https://github.com/wez/wezterm/pull/5576">big progress</a> has been made to implement them (might even be implemented when you read this).<br>
Instead of using floating panes for opening <a href="https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit">Lazygit</a> or similar, I use tabs as a replacement.
While it is almost as good as floating panes, tabs can&rsquo;t quite replace the seamless experience of quickly toggling a floating pane.
As such I sometimes end up having random unused tabs open cluttering my tab bar.</p>
<h5 id="one-multiplexer-window-per-gui-window">One multiplexer window per GUI window</h5>
<p>Wezterm restricts multiplexer windows to only one GUI window. This means that you cannot have 2 instances of the same multiplexer window attached.
In Tmux you can have 2 sessions opened at the same time, by attaching one session in one terminal window, and another session in another terminal window.
This is unfortunately not possible in Wezterm, and can sometimes be annoying if you want to change something in one workspace, based on something from another workspace.</p>
<h2 id="some-general-differences">Some general differences</h2>
<p>There are differences in how Wezterm handles workspaces/sessions Tmux.
This is not good nor bad, but you should be aware of these differences, as they can have an impact on your workflow.</p>
<h5 id="workspaces-vs-sessions">Workspaces vs. Sessions</h5>
<p>In Wezterm the equivalent to Tmux sessions are workspaces. Workspaces work a lot like sessions, in that they contain the state of the multiplexer for that session.
You can switch workspaces just like you can switch sessions, but in Wezterm workspaces also contain windows, as well as tabs and panes.<br>
The image below has an overview of the two, note that Wezterm tabs are equivalent to Tmux windows:</p>

<h5 id="gui-windows-are-a-part-of-workspaces">GUI windows are a part of Workspaces</h5>
<p>In Wezterm the GUI windows are a part of the workspace. That means that when you change workspaces, your GUI will also change. If you have 2 windows open in one workspace, and 1 in the other. Then changing workspaces will remove/add the 2nd window, like in the gif:</p>
<p><img src="/wezterm_replacing_tmux/window_workspace_example.gif" alt="Example of windows being attached to workspaces"></p>
<h2 id="should-you-quit-tmux">Should you quit Tmux?</h2>
<p>After more than a year I can confidently say that I won&rsquo;t be returning to Tmux.
The ability to have multiplexing capabilities on servers without installing Tmux is a game-changer,
and the addition of domains into my workflow has been a significant upgrade.
I also love how easy it has become to configure both my terminal and multiplexer in Lua, thanks to Wezterms well documented APIs.
And with a growing community developing features and plugins, I am sure it is only going to get better.</p>
<p>But should <em>you</em> make the switch?
Honestly both Wezterm and Tmux have really great multiplexing capabilities, and share most features.
If you share some of my annoyances of forgetting to attach or want to experience features like domains, then I can highly recommend giving Wezterm a shot.
In this blog post have only touched upon Wezterms multiplexing features, but it is first and foremost an excellent terminal emulator.
It is well worth trying, just to experience what a modern terminal emulator is like.
And if you are still on the fence, then you can always run Tmux inside Wezterm, to get the best of both worlds.</p>
<p>Oh, and did I mention it is written in <strong>RUST BTW?!!?1!?</strong> 🦀</p>
